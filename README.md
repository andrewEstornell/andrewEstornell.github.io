## Interests and Background

I am a fifth year PhD student studying Computer Science at Washington University in St Louis with my advisors Yevgeniy Vorobeychik and Sanmay Das. My research interests fall broadly within the fields of Machine Learning, Algorithmic Fairness, Optimization, Game Theory, Strategic Classification, and Adversarial Machine Learning. I enjoy working on computational problems, especially those involving the use of Machine Learning in novel or unexpected ways, and those involving multiple strategic agents. Recently my thesis work has focused on Algorithmic Fairness and Strategic Classification, with an emphasis on how these two fields relate to one another. In particular, I have been working on the development of Machine Learning models which are both fair and robust to manipulation by strategic agents. Outside of my thesis work I have recently been pursuing Adversarial Machine Learning in the context of robustness for image recognition models, as well as  Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in the context of ride-sharing.
