I am a fifth-year PhD student studying Computer Science at Washington University in St Louis with my advisors Yevgeniy Vorobeychik and Sanmay Das. 
My research interests fall broadly within the fields of Algorithmic Fairness, Adversarial Machine Learning, Optimization, Game Theory, and Strategic Classification.
I enjoy working on problems from both a theoretical and applied perspective, especially those involving the use of Machine Learning in novel or unexpected ways, and those involving multiple strategic agents. 

Recently my thesis work has focused on Algorithmic Fairness and Strategic Classification, with an emphasis on how these two fields relate to one another. 
When the decisions of machine learning models are consequential enough to metric considerations of fairness (e.g. in automated lending), these decisions are also consequential enough to incentive individuals to behave strategically. 
As such, Algorithmic Fairness and Strategic Classification are fundamentally intertwined; the consideration of strategic behavior is paramount to successful deployment of fair models in practice. To this end, I have been working on the development of machine learning models which are both fair and robust to manipulation by strategic agents. 

Outside of my thesis work I have recently been pursuing Adversarial Machine Learning in the context of robustness for image recognition models, as well as  Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in the context of ride-sharing.
